h3. 1.1.. Give the output that a connectivity algorithm should produce when given the input 0-2, 1-4, 2-5, 3-6, 0-4, 6-0, and 1-3.

0-2 
1-4  - 1 & 4 are are searched in the sets above and none are found
2-5  - 2 is searched in the sets above . 2 is found , so (0-2) U (2-5) = {0,2,5}

so now the sets are
{0,2,5}
{1,4}
i/p = (3,6) -  1 & 4 are are searched in the sets above and none are found . so retained as such {3,6}
i/p = (0,4) -  0 is found in set {0,2,5} and 4 is found in set {1,4}..So {0,4} U {0,2,5} U {1,4} = {1,4,0,2,5}

so now the sets are
{1,4,0,2,5}
{3,6}
ip = (6-0) - 0 and 6 both are found so {1,4,0,2,5} U {3,6} U {0,6} = {1,4,0,2,5,6,3}

Answer : {1,4,0,2,5,6,3}

How to check our answer ?
the answer suggests that from any node we can reach any other node . make a picture of above and see if it is true.

Note : In a 2d set  we cannot represent all the connections exactly .. so in diagram
