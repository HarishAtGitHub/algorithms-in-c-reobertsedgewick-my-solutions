h3. 1.2.. List all the different ways to connect two different objects for the example in Figure 1.1

This seems like a theoretical question. so just graphing out will help us list the ways .

following the procedure as in <a href="https://github.com/HarishAtGitHub/algorithms-in-c-reobertsedgewick-my-solutions/blob/master/chapter1/1.3.textile">1.3textile</a>.

we will come up with the table in

| link | Group No |
| 3-4  | 1        |
| 4-9  | 1        |
| 8-0  | 2 -> 1   |
| 2-3  | 1        |
| 5-6  | 3 -> 1   |
| 2-9  | 1        |
| 5-9  | 1        |
| 7-3  | 1        |
| 4-8  | 1        |
| 5-6  | 1        |
| 7-3  | 1        |
| 4-8  | 1        |
| 5-6  | 1        |
| 0-2  | 1        |
| 6-1  | 1        |

so it means all belong to the same group 
from this we can proceed programmatically .
