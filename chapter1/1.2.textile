h3. 1.2.. List all the different ways to connect two different objects for the example in Figure 1.1

This seems like a theoretical question. so just graphing out will help us list the ways .

So to go from 7 to 0
it is
7-3-2-0
or 
7-3-4-8-0

other roots will result in dead end of revisiting nodes .

To go from program initial step at least to find how many clusters so that we can right away say that "no path exists" if nodes are in different clusters
following the procedure as in <a href="https://github.com/HarishAtGitHub/algorithms-in-c-reobertsedgewick-my-solutions/blob/master/chapter1/1.3.textile">1.3textile</a>.

we will come up with the table in

| link | Group No |
| 3-4  | 1        |
| 4-9  | 1        |
| 8-0  | 2 -> 1   |
| 2-3  | 1        |
| 5-6  | 3 -> 1   |
| 2-9  | 1        |
| 5-9  | 1        |
| 7-3  | 1        |
| 4-8  | 1        |
| 5-6  | 1        |
| 7-3  | 1        |
| 4-8  | 1        |
| 5-6  | 1        |
| 0-2  | 1        |
| 6-1  | 1        |

so it means all belong to the same group so we can go from any node to any node .
